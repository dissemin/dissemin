Building the docs
=================

This documentation is generated by sphinx, both from the source code
and with some additional documentation files.

There are two steps to generate the docs: first, auto-generate the
reStructuredText sources of the docs with sphinx-apidoc::

     # first, make sure you are in an environment where
     # the requirements are available
     source .virtualenv/bin/activate
     # then, invoke sphinx-apidoc via make
     make -B doc


Then, compile these RST sources to HTML::

     cd doc/sphinx ; make html

The HTML output is then available in `doc/sphinx/_build/html/`.
