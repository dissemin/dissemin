Welcome to Dissemin's documentation!
====================================

Dissemin is a web platform gathering academic publications and analyzing
their online availability as well as publisher policy. This documentation
explains how it works and how to use it.

This serves as the main location for the documentation. First, you might
want to refer to :ref:`page-install`.

You will also need to follow :ref:`page-apikeys` to have access
to the metadata sources.
